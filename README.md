This plugins adds a new Warhead to SCP:SL. It can be activated replacing Alpha Warhead with the Omega Warhead (deactivated by default) or via commands (activateomegawarhead). The ways to survive the Omega Warhead are 2:
1. Stay in the Breach/Evacuation Shelter
2. Escape in the rescue Helicopter at surface zone.
